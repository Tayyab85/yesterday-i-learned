- [Korea had the world's longest unbroken chain of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Korea) because their society has been so stable. Many other places have just as much slavery, just not continuously.

- Propaganda played a big role in helping the "allied powers" [win the ](https://www.ephemerasociety.org/demonizing-our-wwii-enemies/), so don't tell me they don't brainwash their citizens.
- The [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) was created during World War II because the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations), a very similar organisation during World War I, failed to prevent wars. Apparently that was because [actions needed to be unanimous](https://time.com/5507628/league-of-nations-history-legacy/), so clearly it can't resolve conflicts if there ever is one (Germany and Japan not cooperating means a vote can't ever be unanimous). The UN's first goal is to [prevent another world war](https://www.historydiscussion.net/history/the-united-nations-aims-organs-and-other-details/1683). Therefore, while civil wars and genocides do occur from time to time, it is in the UN's interest to do exactly nothing about it, if the conflict is limited to a single country.
- [Mantell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Mantell) made discovery about dinosaur bones. [Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen) ripped off his work (among tons of other people's work). Mantell died at age 62. Owen was knighted and lived to 88. Guess being a good guy doesn't pay.

- The English government spoke and wrote French from 1066 until 1488. English was the language of the peasants.
- "... The cloud is the new time-share mainframe. ... Programming in the 1960s to 80s was like this too. You'd develop some program in isolation, unable to properly run it. You "submit" it to the system, and it would be scheduled to run along with other workloads. You'd get a printout of the results back hours later, or even tomorrow. Rinse and repeat. This work loop is incredibly inefficient, and was replaced by development that happened entirely locally on a workstation. This dramatically tightened the edit-compile-debug loop, down to seconds or at most minutes. Productivity skyrocketed, and most enterprises shifted the majority of their workload away from mainframes." - [jiggawatts](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26857859), on AWS lambda, and history of computing

- Hitler was't racist in the traditional sense that he didn't like people of a certain skin; he was racist in the sense that [he believed every race other than the Aryan race was inferior](https://knappily.com/onthisday/february-3-1933-hitler-demands-living-space-for-germany-375).
- There once was a literal aphrodisiac plant, [silphium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium)... the Romans harvested it to extinction.
- There once was a time when Germany defined a sword as a two-edged blade, while knives all have two pieces of wood sandwiching the handle. So "knives" like the huge [messer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messer_%28weapon%29) existed. Unlike swords, messers could be legally owned by civilians.
- Hong Kong SAR has never won a [gold medal at the Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_at_the_Olympics). The first and only gold medal was won in 1996, before the handover.

- [Easter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island) was ruined by the [Rapa Nui peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapa_Nui_people) 300 ~ 1000 years ago. The clans on there competed to build huge stone man statues called the Moai, which required a lot of wood to hold and transport, destroying the habitat there. As well, they hunted all birds to extinction, and they ate their own kind. When Chile (the government that held the place) suggested building a marine park and reserve in 2010/2011, the people there rejected the proposal.
- Chiang Kai-shek [didn't drink, didn't smoke, and lived a simple, frugal life](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%94%A3%E4%B8%AD%E6%AD%A3).
- Despite the difference in size, Little Boy killed twice as many people as Fat Man. [Fat Man missed the target by two miles](https://old.reddit.com/r/ThingsCutInHalfPorn/comments/k09n5q/crosssections_of_little_boy_and_fat_man_nuclear/gdh1sj8/) because the plane didn't do too well that day.

Now they eat [way more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_drive_hunting#Japan) [types of meat than they should](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling_in_Japan).
- The Republic of China (Taiwan) signed the [universal declaration of human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights). The People's Republic of China did not (because it didn't exist in 1948). Islamic countries have [their own declaration of human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Declaration_on_Human_Rights_in_Islam) so they didn't sign the universal one, either.
- There are seven days in a [week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week) for long, historical reasons, perhaps cannot be traced back. However, in most languages deriving from Latin make use of planetary body names, which suggest the people saw seven things in the sky that doesn't stay in the same place, and [mistook them as gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpRd52dXHlQ).
- There have always been people who are against wearing masks. See 1918: [Anti-Mask League of San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Mask_League_of_San_Francisco).

Four days later, Frenchmen [Jacques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Heim) and [Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_R%C3%A9ard) invented the [Bikini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini), which the Marshallese never wore.

- The allied forces [bombed the fuck out of Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II) (not their words), killing 58,000 civilians. Apparently hiding in bomb shelters was not a good idea, as the fires above sucked all the oxygen out of the ground.
- The "black" in Black Sea only means it's North. For some reason, [the Chinese used black for "North", green/blue for "East", white for "West", and red for "South"](https://www.polyglottando.com/?p=3444), and for some other reason, the Turkish people also used it, which meant [the Greeks also used it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea#Name), which is why it's the "Black" Sea today. See also: the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea#Names), south of it.
- [Decimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimation_%28Roman_army%29) (where "decimated" came from) is like the Roman army laying off 10% of its workers (called "soldiers"), except instead of getting laid off, you die.

- A single downward triangle in [Nazi camp badging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camp_badge) meant social democrats, liberals, socialists, communists, anarchists, gentiles who assisted Jews; trade unionists; and Freemasons. Overlaying that on top of an upward yellow triangle, and you get the star of David, making you also a Jew.
- [Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco) was a Spanish dictator who ruled the country until 1975. [He makes Android kernels](https://twitter.com/franciscof_1990) and [apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8270010790606670648) now.

"The Mexican-German Conspiracy of 1915", The Americas. 23.1 (1966): 76)*
- According to /u/merimus_maximus in [a ChangeMyView post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9xb9ji/cmv_japans_government_needs_to_be_held/e9rcvf8/), Japan has already apologised to the world, to the maximum extent that they can, for what it did in World War II, but the Japanese style of apology is seen as insincere, and some of it was lost in translation because the Japanese language infers things a lot. This theory doesn't explain [why they don't talk about it as much as the Germans do](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9xb9ji/cmv_japans_government_needs_to_be_held/e9rpjsb/), language differences included.

Everything the US experts (who? wall street?) recommended destroyed Russia's economy ("[They] divvy up Russia's vast natural resources and state corporations among a handful of oligarchs who, in turn, sold a chunk of the ownership to western elites for pennies on the dollar"). The article even said the US succeeded in dismantling Russia's military. Then in 1998 Putin appeared.

- Up until the 1970s, English was the prestige language of Hong Kong due to colonialism, and [Mandarin was more prestiged than Cantonese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XufH-qFy4Cc) because "coming from the North" was for some reason a good thing (not explained by RTHK).

As a result, Japan was converted to an American ally, and didn't get punished [for WW2] nearly as hard as they should have been.
- [Extreme poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-history-methods): the rate had nosedived since the 1800s (which was 80%). GDP per capita is exponentially increasing. People live longer. The world is better [for people, not the planet] now than it was in any time period.

- Despite being on the losing side, [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek) (蔣介石) never wanted to split Taiwan from China. He wanted the whole China, and an island nation, to him, was not a valid compromise.
- Henry VIII [tried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England#Reformation) to turn the whole country from catholicism to protestantism by killing everyone who opposed his protestant divorce.

After she died of [either infected ovarian cysts, cancer, or something made up entirely in her head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttt2jJhQyhU), [Elizabeth I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England), his Protestant daughter, rose to the throne (1558) and [undid that heresy law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England#Church_settlement).

It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But _I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement_. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years." Note how he didn't say _the_ billion-dollar mistake, simply one that was his.

That, or it could have been a form of [systems collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_collapse#Systems_science), where the society grew so large that the cost to maintain it exceeds the "GDP" the civilisation could muster. The Roman empire is said to have failed that way.

It's quite weird to say this, but a good comparison of how a gladiator was handpicked and cared for is with the same way racehorses are treated today.

As being buried in a faulty pyramid would be a huge loss of face, Sneferu commissioned a third pyramid, simultaneously as they were salvaging the Bent Pyramid and converting his first pyramid to a true one, just in case Sneferu died before his 3rd pyramid was finished. Needless to say, this triple construction project put a huge strain on Egypy's economy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/comments/a9okam/how_bout_we_build_3_pyramids_at_the_same_time/ecl1qkt/)
